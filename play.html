<h2>LADY WINDERMERE’S FAN</h2>
<h3>ACT IV._Morning-room in Lord Windermere’s house_.LADY WINDERMERE. Description: [_Lying on sofa_.]  How can I tell him?  I can’t tell
    him.  It would kill me.  I wonder what happened after I escaped from that
    horrible room.  Perhaps she told them the true reason of her being there,
    and the real meaning of that—fatal fan of mine.  Oh, if he knows—how can
    I look him in the face again?  He would never forgive me.  [_Touches
    bell_.]  How securely one thinks one lives—out of reach of temptation,
    sin, folly.  And then suddenly—Oh!  Life is terrible.  It rules us, we do
    not rule it.</h3>
