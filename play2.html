    <h5 class="hopper">HOPPER.</h5>  <p class="speech">Capital place, London!  They are not nearly so exclusive in
London as they are in Sydney.</p>

<h5 class="duchessberwick">DUCHESS OF BERWICK. </h5> <p class="speech">Ah! we know your value, Mr. Hopper.  We wish there
were more like you.  It would make life so much easier.  Do you know, Mr.
Hopper, dear Agatha and I are so much interested in Australia.  It must
be so pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying about.  Agatha has
found it on the map.  What a curious shape it is!  Just like a large
packing case.  However, it is a very young country, isn’t it?</p>

<h5 class="hopper">HOPPER.</h5> <p class="speech"> Wasn’t it made at the same time as the others, Duchess?</p>
